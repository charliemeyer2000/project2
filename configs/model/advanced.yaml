# Advanced Autoencoder Configuration
# Designed to achieve rank #1 with CBAM attention and optimal architecture

architecture: advanced
latent_dim: 8  # OPTIMAL for latent dimension score (40% weight)

# Architecture parameters (optimized for ~21.5MB, under 23MB limit)
base_channels: 36
depth_multiplier: 1.55

# Skip connections are CRITICAL for performance
use_skip_connections: true

# Activation and normalization
activation_type: tanh  # Better than sigmoid for this task
norm_type: group  # Better than batch for inference stability

# Expected performance:
# - Latent Dim Score: 1.000 (LD=8 is optimal)
# - Model Size: ~21.5 MB (under 23MB limit)
# - Should achieve rank #1-3 with proper training
