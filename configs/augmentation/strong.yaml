# Strong augmentation - aggressive but realistic
# Good for: Preventing overfitting, robust feature learning

data:
  augment: true
  augmentation_strength: strong

# Strong includes (traffic light optimized):
# - Aggressive color jitter: brightness ±40%, contrast ±40%, saturation ±30%
#   (simulates: extreme lighting, harsh weather - still NO HUE!)
# - Small rotation (±3°) - realistic camera tilt
# - Translation (±8%) - larger camera position variations
# - Zoom (90-110%) - wider range of distances
# - Very mild perspective distortion (5%, 20% probability) - lens effects
#
# Still AVOIDS:
# - NO horizontal flips (driving context matters)
# - NO hue changes (CRITICAL: red/yellow/green must stay accurate!)
# - NO large rotations (traffic lights are vertical structures)
