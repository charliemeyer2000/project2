# Medium augmentation - balanced, traffic-light optimized
# Good for: Most use cases, realistic driving variations

data:
  augment: true
  augmentation_strength: medium

# Medium includes (traffic light optimized):
# - Color jitter: brightness ±30%, contrast ±30%, saturation ±20%
#   (simulates: day/night, weather, sun glare - NO HUE changes!)
# - Very small rotation (±2°) - only camera tilt
# - Small translation (±5%) - camera position varies
# - Small zoom (95-105%) - distance to traffic light varies
#
# Specifically AVOIDS:
# - NO horizontal flips (traffic lights have specific orientation)
# - NO hue changes (red/yellow/green MUST be preserved!)
# - NO large rotations (traffic lights are vertical)
